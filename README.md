# Earthquake Service

This program shows the most recent 1.0 scale earthquakes.
The user has an option to choose whether they want to see earthquakes 
from the last hour or from the last 30 days.
When a location is clicked, it automatically takes the user to the exact coordinates
of the earthquake using its latitude and longitude.
